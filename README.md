# Unveiling-the-Netflix-Universe-Exploring-Content-Trends-and-Preferences
In our project, we use visualization to show which shows and movies are popular and why. By looking at what people watch a lot, we can see what types of shows and movies are the most exciting to them. Our project helps us understand why people like certain things on Netflix and how we can show that information.

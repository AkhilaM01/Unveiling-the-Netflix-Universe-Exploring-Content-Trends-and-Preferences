# Unveiling-the-Netflix-Universe-Exploring-Content-Trends-and-Preferences
In our project, we use visualization to show which shows and movies are popular and why. By looking at what people watch a lot, we can see what types of shows and movies are the most exciting to them. Our project helps us understand why people like certain things on Netflix and how we can show that information.

Potential stories we explored:
Animated Trend Analysis: How has the number of TV shows and movies added to the platform changed over the years?
Content Distribution: What are the most common genres of content available? Is there a difference in genre preferences between TV shows and movies? 
Regional Analysis: Which countries produce the most content? Are there regional preferences in terms of content types or genres?
Distribution of content ratings on Netflix: How does the distribution of content ratings on Netflix impact viewer engagement and subscriber retention?
Interactive Genre Dynamics on Netflix: How does the variety and evolution of genres on Netflix correlate with subscriber engagement and content strategy effectiveness?
Detailed Genre Cataloging on Netflix: How can the distribution of titles across various genres inform Netflix's content acquisition and production strategy to optimize viewer satisfaction and retention?
Interactive Exploration Dashboard: Netflix Content Trends and Popularity

We have also made some business implications and recommendations based on the stories of our visualization. (All included in the report)
